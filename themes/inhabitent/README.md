# Wordpress: Custom Themes
## InhabiTent Camping Supply Company
### Overview
This site is a mock-up for a fictional camping company that involves custom page types like Adventures and Products which are registered to the wordpress back-end for easy client maintenance. Price had to be created as a custom field and dot leaders were added. The product-type custom taxonomy was created to manage the Do-Eat-Sleep-Wear product taxonomy. Many functions were added to filter search results, add actions, and enqueue scripts and styles.

### Custom Widgets
The business hours section is a custom widget that prevents clients from deleting content they cannot recreate easily. The only data exposed for modification are the fields of time ranges. This protects style and format from accidental deletion.

### Functionality Plugin
All theme-independent style was bundled into a functionality plugin to preserve site functionality if the client decided to change themes.
